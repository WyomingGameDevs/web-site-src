				<h3>What is a Game Jam?<br>Build a game in 48 hours!</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Wyoming Game Jam is a <strong>FREE</strong> 48-hour event were people come together to make games. Participants work in teams to write code, create art, compose music, construct sound effects, and design gameplay. The goal is not only to emerge with something “finished” and playable, but to also learn from one other and practice the art of game design. 2018 is the first annual event!</p>
